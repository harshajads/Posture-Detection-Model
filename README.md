# Posture-Detection-Model
The model has been developed in python tensorflow and is capable of directly working with LabView environment using python nodes.
ML_Model contains the code related to train the model using 4 sensor data inputs, two 1*2 FSR sensor arrays, IR sensor and the Ultrasonic sensor.
model_loader contains the functions capable of loading the model into the running environment and predictiing the posture with it's precentage of certainty. 
Test.xlx file contains the dataset used to train the model.
